The personal portfolio website is a responsive, single-page web application created using only HTML and CSS. It showcases the academic background, skills, and project work of Ishika Paunikar, a B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student at Symbiosis Institute of Technology. Designed with simplicity and elegance in mind, the website provides a clean and modern interface to present professional information. The structure is neatly organized with clear sections such as About, Projects, and Contact, making it easy for viewers to navigate and explore the content.

The header section introduces the user with a name and a brief professional tagline, followed by a sticky navigation bar that remains fixed at the top for smooth in-page navigation. The About section provides a short biography, focusing on Ishikaâ€™s interests in full-stack development and UI/UX design. This section reflects her enthusiasm for web technologies and highlights her learning journey and future aspirations in the software development domain. The typography, color scheme, and layout have been thoughtfully chosen to maintain readability and visual appeal.

The Projects section is a major highlight of the portfolio. It features a grid layout with five project cards, each representing an individual project. These projects include a portfolio website, a student management system using Python and SQLite, a quiz application built with JavaScript, an NGO ranking dashboard with visual data representation, and a weather application that uses the OpenWeatherMap API. Each card contains a project title and a short description to help viewers understand its purpose and key features at a glance. The use of a responsive CSS grid ensures that the project section adapts well to different screen sizes.

The Contact section includes clickable links for email and LinkedIn, making it easy for potential employers, mentors, or collaborators to reach out. A clean footer at the bottom includes a copyright message and adds a final touch of professionalism to the site. The entire website is built without using any JavaScript or frameworks, demonstrating a strong command of semantic HTML and CSS for layout, styling, and responsive design. Key styling techniques used include Flexbox, Grid, box shadows, rounded corners, and color contrast for links and interactive elements.

Overall, the portfolio website reflects both technical and design skills. It is lightweight, fast-loading, and accessible on any modern browser or device. It can be easily deployed using GitHub Pages, making it a practical tool for building a personal brand and professional presence online. This project serves as an effective showcase of frontend development fundamentals and is ideal for resumes, job applications, or academic submissions. It can also be expanded in the future by adding JavaScript interactivity, animations, contact forms, or integration with backend services.
